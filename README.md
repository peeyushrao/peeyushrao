# 👋 Hi there, I'm Peeyush Rao

### 🧠 Generalist System Admin turned Security Engineer

I am what you’d call a **“generalist system administrator”** — my knowledge is a mile wide and an inch deep, which, in my humble opinion, isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In a few years, I’ll hit two decades in the IT industry.

Over time, my career has naturally pivoted toward **information security**, where I now work in a **Global Security Operations Center (SOC)** with a focus on:

- 🔐 **SSE (Security Service Edge)**
- 🛡️ **Endpoint Defense**
- 🎯 **Threat Detection and Response**

I regularly work with tools like **CrowdStrike Falcon**, **Zscaler**, and **SIEM platforms**, and I’m steadily growing in areas like:

- 🕵️‍♂️ Threat Hunting
- 🚨 Incident Response
- 🤖 Security Automation
